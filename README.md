# LlamaGen.Ai REST API

The LlamaGen Comic API allows you to generate and retrieve comic artwork using AI-powered image generation. This API provides endpoints to create comic artwork based on prompts and retrieve the generated comic panels with different styles.

## Introduction

The LlamaGen Comic API offers three main methods for interacting with comic images:

1. Creating comic panels from scratch based on a text prompt
2. Retrieving generated comic artwork
3. (Future feature) Creating variations of existing comic panels

This guide covers the basics of using these API endpoints with useful code samples.

## Usage

### Create Comic Artwork

Creates a new comic artwork based on the provided prompt and other parameters.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.llamagen.ai/v1/comics/generations" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $LLAMAGENAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "model": "cyani-model",
  "prompt": "a comic about a cat and a dog",
  "size": "1024x1024"
}'
```

#### Parameters

- `model` (string): The AI model to use for generation (e.g., "cyani-model")
- `prompt` (string): A text description of the desired comic scene
- `size` (string): The size of the generated image (e.g., "1024x1024")

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "cm20e3dnb00097k8753vd0wt4",
  "status": "LOADING",
  "prompt": "a comic about a cat and a dog"
}
```

The response includes the ID of the created comic artwork, which can be used to retrieve the comic panels later.

### Retrieve Comic Artwork

Retrieves the generated comic panels for a specific artwork ID.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.llamagen.ai/v1/comics/generations/YOUR_ARTWORK_ID" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "cm20e3dnb00097k8753vd0wt4",
  "status": "LOADING",
  "prompt": "a comic about a cat and a dog",
  "comics": [
    {
      "page": 0,
      "panels": [
        {
          "assetUrl": "",
          "panel": 0,
          "caption": ""
        },
        {
          "assetUrl": "",
          "panel": 1,
          "caption": ""
        },
        {
          "assetUrl": "",
          "panel": 2,
          "caption": ""
        },
        {
          "assetUrl": "",
          "panel": 3,
          "caption": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response includes the status of the comic artwork and the `comicData` field containing a JSON-encoded string representing the comic panels.
